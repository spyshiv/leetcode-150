# Two Sum

The **Two Sum** problem is one of the most popular and frequently asked coding interview questions. It evaluates your ability to work with arrays and hash maps efficiently.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they **add up to** the target.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may **not use the same element twice**.

You can return the answer in **any order**.

---

### 🧪 Example

```js
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

---

## 🧠 Brute Force Approach

### 💡 Idea:

Use two loops to try every pair of elements and check if their sum equals the target.

### 🚫 Not Recommended for Interviews

```js
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target) {
                return [i, j];
            }
        }
    }
};
```

-   **Time Complexity:** O(n²)

-   **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## ⚡ Optimal Approach: Using a Hash Map

### 💡 Idea:

Use a hash map to store the **value-to-index** mapping of each number as you iterate. For every element `num`, check if `target - num` exists in the map.

### ✅ JavaScript Code:

```js
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    const map = new Map(); // value -> index

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];

        if (map.has(complement)) {
            return [map.get(complement), i];
        }

        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }

    return []; // fallback, though the problem guarantees one solution
};
```

## 🕒 Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Time Complexity** | O(n) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(n) |

-   `n` = number of elements in the array

-   We traverse the array once and use a hash map to store seen values


---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Example

**Input:** `nums = [3, 2, 4]`, `target = 6`

-   Iteration 1: `i=0`, `num=3`, `complement=3` → not found → store 3 → `map = {3: 0}`

-   Iteration 2: `i=1`, `num=2`, `complement=4` → not found → store 2 → `map = {3: 0, 2: 1}`

-   Iteration 3: `i=2`, `num=4`, `complement=2` → found! → return `[1, 2]`


---

## 🧷 Edge Cases

-   ✅ Array has negative numbers

-   ✅ Target is 0

-   ❌ Using same element twice is **not allowed**

-   ✅ Exactly one solution guaranteed


---

## 🏆 Best Practices

-   Use hash maps for fast lookup (O(1))

-   Avoid nested loops unless absolutely necessary

-   Handle edge cases in the beginning
