# Understanding Isomorphic Strings

When solving string transformation problems, one challenge that often pops up in coding interviews is determining whether two strings are **isomorphic**. A common string manipulation question tests your understanding of **mappings** and **consistency checks** in algorithms.

In this article, we’ll break down the **problem**, explain the **approach**, walk through the **JavaScript solution**, and share some **notes** to deepen your understanding.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Two strings `s` and `t` are called **isomorphic** if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`. The rules are:

- Each character in `s` must map to one character in `t`.
- No two characters in `s` can map to the same character in `t`.
- The order of characters must be preserved.

In simple terms, it’s a **one-to-one mapping** problem.

### Examples:
```js
isIsomorphic("egg", "add");     // true
isIsomorphic("foo", "bar");     // false
isIsomorphic("paper", "title"); // true
isIsomorphic("ab", "aa");       // false
````

## 🧩 Understanding the Algorithm

To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to maintain a consistent mapping between characters from `s` to `t` **and** from `t` to `s`.

Why both directions?

Because just checking one direction (like `s -> t`) may allow multiple characters in `s` to map to the same character in `t`, which violates the one-to-one constraint.

### 🚫 Common Pitfall:

Using character **frequency** comparison doesn't work, because two different characters might have the same frequency but map to different positions, which would make the strings **not isomorphic**.

## ✅ JavaScript Solution using `Map`

Here's the clean, reliable way to solve this using JavaScript's `Map`:

```js
/**
 * Determines if two strings are isomorphic.
 * @param {string} s - First string
 * @param {string} t - Second string
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isIsomorphic = function(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) return false;

    const mapST = new Map(); // s → t mapping
    const mapTS = new Map(); // t → s mapping

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const c1 = s[i];
        const c2 = t[i];

        if (mapST.has(c1)) {
            if (mapST.get(c1) !== c2) return false;
        } else {
            mapST.set(c1, c2);
        }

        if (mapTS.has(c2)) {
            if (mapTS.get(c2) !== c1) return false;
        } else {
            mapTS.set(c2, c1);
        }
    }

    return true;
};
```

### How it works:

-   Loop through both strings simultaneously.

-   For each character in `s` and its corresponding character in `t`, check if the mapping is already established.

-   If a mismatch is found in either mapping direction, return `false`.

-   If all characters map consistently, return `true`.

## 📌 Notes & Gotchas

-   ✅ Always check both mappings: `s → t` and `t → s`.

-   ❌ Don’t use frequency counts — they ignore positional integrity.

-   ✅ Use `Map` over plain objects in modern JavaScript for more consistent behavior.
