# Understanding Isomorphic Strings: Problem, Approach, and JavaScript Solution

When solving string transformation problems, one challenge that often pops up in coding interviews is determining whether two strings are **isomorphic**. It's a common string manipulation question that tests your understanding of **mappings** and **consistency checks** in algorithms.

In this article, we‚Äôll break down the **problem**, explain the **approach**, walk through the **JavaScript solution**, and share some **notes** to deepen your understanding.

## üîç Problem Statement

Two strings `s` and `t` are called **isomorphic** if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`. The rules are:

- Each character in `s` must map to one character in `t`.
- No two characters in `s` can map to the same character in `t`.
- The order of characters must be preserved.

In simple terms, it‚Äôs a **one-to-one mapping** problem.

### Examples:
```js
isIsomorphic("egg", "add");     // true
isIsomorphic("foo", "bar");     // false
isIsomorphic("paper", "title"); // true
isIsomorphic("ab", "aa");       // false
