# Word Pattern

The **Word Pattern** problem is a common string manipulation challenge often asked in coding interviews. It tests your understanding of **pattern matching** and **string mapping**.

In this article, we will break down the **problem**, explain the **approach**, walk through the **JavaScript solution**, and provide some **notes** for better clarity.

## üîç Problem Statement

Given a string `pattern` and a string `s`, return `true` if `s` follows the same pattern.

Here‚Äôs how the pattern matching works:

-   Each letter in the pattern corresponds to a word in the string `s`.

-   Each letter in the pattern must map to a **unique word** and vice versa.


### Rules:

-   The length of the `pattern` and the number of words in `s` must be the same.

-   The letters in the pattern map uniquely to words in `s` and vice versa.


### Examples:

```js
wordPattern("abba", "dog cat cat dog");   // true
wordPattern("abba", "dog cat cat fish");  // false
wordPattern("aaaa", "dog cat cat dog");  // false
wordPattern("abba", "dog dog dog dog");  // false
```

## üß© Understanding the Algorithm

To determine if `s` follows the same pattern as `pattern`, we need to establish a **one-to-one mapping** between the characters in the `pattern` and the words in the string `s`.

### Key Observations:

1.  **Length Mismatch:** If the length of `pattern` doesn't match the number of words in `s`, return `false` immediately.

2.  **One-to-One Mapping:** Each character in `pattern` must map to a unique word, and no two characters in `pattern` can map to the same word.

3.  **Reverse Mapping:** Similarly, each word in `s` must map to a unique character in `pattern`.

## ‚úÖ JavaScript Solution using Hash Maps

The best solution to this problem is to use two hash maps (or objects) to store the mappings from `pattern` to words and from words to `pattern`. This ensures a **one-to-one mapping** in both directions.

### JavaScript Code:

```js
/**
 * Determines if string `s` follows the same pattern as `pattern`.
 * @param {string} pattern - The pattern string.
 * @param {string} s - The string to check.
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var wordPattern = function(pattern, s) {
    const words = s.split(' ');
    if (pattern.length !== words.length) return false;

    const mapPatternToWord = new Map();
    const mapWordToPattern = new Map();

    for (let i = 0; i < pattern.length; i++) {
        const char = pattern[i];
        const word = words[i];

        if (mapPatternToWord.has(char)) {
            if (mapPatternToWord.get(char) !== word) return false;
        } else {
            mapPatternToWord.set(char, word);
        }

        if (mapWordToPattern.has(word)) {
            if (mapWordToPattern.get(word) !== char) return false;
        } else {
            mapWordToPattern.set(word, char);
        }
    }

    return true;
};
```

### How it works:

1.  **Step 1:** First, split the string `s` into individual words.

2.  **Step 2:** Check if the length of the pattern matches the number of words. If not, return `false`.

3.  **Step 3:** Use two hash maps (`mapPatternToWord` and `mapWordToPattern`) to track the mappings between characters and words.

4.  **Step 4:** For each character in `pattern` and the corresponding word in `s`, ensure the mappings are consistent.

    -   If the character has been seen before and doesn't map to the same word, return `false`.

    -   Similarly, ensure the word hasn‚Äôt been mapped to a different character.

5.  **Step 5:** If all checks pass, return `true`.

## üïí Time Complexity

-   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `pattern` (or the number of words in `s`). The loop iterates through the string once, and each operation inside the loop (like getting and setting values in the map) takes constant time.

-   **Space Complexity:** O(n), for the space used by the two maps.


---

## üìå Notes & Gotchas

-   ‚úÖ **Case Sensitivity:** This problem is case-sensitive, meaning "a" and "A" are treated as different characters.

-   ‚úÖ **Multiple Spaces:** Ensure there are no extra spaces in the string `s`, as splitting `s` with `.split(' ')` will treat consecutive spaces as empty words.

-   ‚úÖ **Uniqueness Check:** Both maps ensure that the mappings are **one-to-one** and **unique**.

-   ‚ùå **Order Matters:** The order of characters in `pattern` and words in `s` must match exactly.

-   ‚úÖ **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases like empty strings or strings with different lengths.
