# Group Anagrams

The **Group Anagrams** problem is a popular coding interview question that checks your understanding of string manipulation and hashing techniques. The core idea is to identify and group strings that are **anagrams** of each other.

In this article, we'll go over the **problem statement**, walk through **two approaches** with code, and analyze their **time and space complexity**.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

### What is an Anagram?

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word. For example:

-   `"listen"` and `"silent"`

-   `"eat"`, `"tea"`, `"ate"`


---

### 🧪 Example

```js
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["eat","tea","ate"],["tan","nat"],["bat"]]
```

---

## 🧠 Approach 1: Using a Sorted Key

Sort each word's characters alphabetically and use the result as a key in a hash map. All words with the same sorted key are anagrams.

### ✅ JavaScript Code

```js
/**
 * Groups anagrams by sorting each word.
 * @param {string[]} strs
 * @return {string[][]}
 */
var groupAnagrams = function(strs) {
    const map = new Map();

    for (let word of strs) {
        const key = word.split('').sort().join('');
        if (!map.has(key)) {
            map.set(key, []);
        }
        map.get(key).push(word);
    }

    return Array.from(map.values());
};
```

### ⏱ Complexity

-   **Time Complexity:** O(n * k log k)

    -   `n`: number of strings

    -   `k`: average length of each string

    -   Sorting takes O(k log k) per string

-   **Space Complexity:** O(nk)

    -   Storing all strings in a hash map


---

## ⚡️ Approach 2: Using Character Count as Key

Instead of sorting, count the number of each character in the string and use that as the key.

### ✅ JavaScript Code

```js
/**
 * Groups anagrams using character frequency count as key.
 * @param {string[]} strs
 * @return {string[][]}
 */
var groupAnagrams = function(strs) {
    const map = new Map();

    for (let word of strs) {
        const count = new Array(26).fill(0);
        for (let char of word) {
            count[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        }
        const key = count.join('#'); // use a delimiter to prevent collisions
        if (!map.has(key)) {
            map.set(key, []);
        }
        map.get(key).push(word);
    }

    return Array.from(map.values());
};
```

### ⏱ Complexity

-   **Time Complexity:** O(n * k)

    -   Count array computation is O(k), and you do it for each of `n` strings

-   **Space Complexity:** O(nk)

    -   Count arrays as keys and store all grouped strings


---

## 🤔 Which Approach is Better?

| Approach | Time Complexity | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sorted Key** | O(n * k log k) | Easy to implement | Slower due to sorting |
| **Character Count** | O(n * k) | Faster for large inputs | Slightly more complex |

> ✅ Use **character count** approach for optimal performance, especially with longer strings.

---

## 🧷 Notes & Edge Cases

-   Strings can be empty: `[""] → [[""]]`

-   Single characters: `["a"] → [["a"]]`

-   All strings are unique (no anagram pairs): return each in a separate group
