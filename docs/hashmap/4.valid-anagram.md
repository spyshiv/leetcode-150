# Valid Anagram

Anagram problems are frequently asked in coding interviews. A common challenge is determining whether two strings are **anagrams** of each other. This problem tests your ability to efficiently manipulate and compare strings.

In this article, we will break down the **problem**, explain the **approach**, walk through the **JavaScript solution**, and provide some **notes** to enhance your understanding.

## üîç Problem Statement

Two strings `s` and `t` are **anagrams** if the characters in `s` can be rearranged to form `t`. In other words, both strings must contain exactly the same characters with the same frequencies.

### Rules:

-   Both strings must have the same length.

-   Both strings must contain the exact same characters, including frequencies.


In simple terms, it‚Äôs a **frequency matching** problem.

### Examples:

```js
isAnagram("anagram", "nagaram");  // true
isAnagram("rat", "car");          // false
isAnagram("listen", "silent");    // true
isAnagram("hello", "world");      // false
```

## üß© Understanding the Algorithm

To determine if two strings are anagrams, we need to check that both strings have the same characters with the same frequencies.

### Key Observations:

1.  The strings must have the same length; otherwise, they can‚Äôt be anagrams.

2.  We need to check that each character in `s` appears the same number of times in `t`.

## ‚úÖ JavaScript Solution using Frequency Count (Array) ‚Äî Best Solution

The most efficient solution in terms of time complexity is using a **frequency count** with a fixed-size array for storing character counts. This approach runs in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space, making it the fastest for large strings.

```js
/**
 * Determines if two strings are anagrams.
 * @param {string} s - First string
 * @param {string} t - Second string
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isAnagram = function(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) return false;

    const count = new Array(26).fill(0);  // Count array for 'a' to 'z'

    // Count the frequency of each character
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        count[s.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        count[t.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]--;
    }

    // Check if all counts are 0 (all frequencies match)
    return count.every(c => c === 0);
};
```

### How it works:

-   **Step 1:** Initialize a count array to track the frequency of each character ('a' to 'z').

-   **Step 2:** For each character in both strings, increment the count for `s` and decrement the count for `t`.

-   **Step 3:** If all counts are `0`, the strings are anagrams.


### üïí Time Complexity:

-   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We traverse the strings once, and the operations inside the loop are constant time.

-   **Space Complexity:** O(1), since the count array has a fixed size (26) for the alphabet.

## ‚úÖ JavaScript Solution using Hash Map

Another efficient solution is to use a **hash map** to count the frequency of characters in both strings. It runs in **O(n)** time, but it uses **O(n)** space due to the hash map storage.

```js
/**
 * Determines if two strings are anagrams.
 * @param {string} s - First string
 * @param {string} t - Second string
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isAnagram = function(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) return false;
    const map = {};

    // Count characters in s
    for (let char of s) {
        map[char] = (map[char] || 0) + 1;
    }

    // Decrease the count for characters in t
    for (let char of t) {
        if (!map[char]) return false;
        map[char] -= 1;
    }

    return true;
};
```

### How it works:

-   **Step 1:** Check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are the same. If not, return `false`.

-   **Step 2:** Create a hash map to count characters in `s`.

-   **Step 3:** Traverse `t` and decrease the corresponding counts in the map.

-   **Step 4:** If any character in `t` does not exist or has a count of zero in the map, return `false`.

-   **Step 5:** If all counts are correctly decremented, return `true`.


### üïí Time Complexity:

-   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We traverse both strings once and perform constant-time operations on the hash map.

-   **Space Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. The hash map stores the character counts.

## ‚úÖ JavaScript Solution using Sorting

While sorting is a simple and elegant solution, it is **less efficient** than the previous two approaches due to its O(n log n) time complexity. Sorting both strings and comparing them works, but it can be slower for larger inputs.

```js
/**
 * Determines if two strings are anagrams.
 * @param {string} s - First string
 * @param {string} t - Second string
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isAnagram = function(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) return false;

    // Sort both strings and compare
    return s.split('').sort().join('') === t.split('').sort().join('');
};
```

### How it works:

-   **Step 1:** Check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are the same. If they aren't, return `false`.

-   **Step 2:** Convert both strings to arrays of characters, sort them, and then join them back into strings.

-   **Step 3:** If the sorted strings are equal, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.


### üïí Time Complexity:

-   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where `n` is the length of the string. Sorting the strings takes O(n log n).

-   **Space Complexity:** O(n), for the arrays created while sorting.

## üìå Notes & Gotchas

-   ‚úÖ **Sorting vs Frequency Count:** Sorting has a time complexity of O(n log n), which may be less efficient for large strings. The frequency count approach runs in O(n), which is faster for larger inputs.

-   ‚ùå **Case Sensitivity:** The problem assumes case sensitivity. For example, `"abc"` and `"ABC"` would not be anagrams.

-   ‚úÖ **Handling Non-Alphabetic Characters:** If needed, the algorithm can be adapted to handle strings with special characters or spaces by normalizing the input.

-   ‚úÖ **JavaScript Objects vs Arrays for Counting:** When counting characters, arrays are more efficient than objects in this case, but both work fine.
